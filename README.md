# Exploratory-data-analysis--US-wildfire
Exploratory data analysis on US wildfire using SQLite and Python

## Why this dataset?
This is my first attempt on working with SQLite and I chose this dataset because it has a good amount of data (not too big or small). It is also one of the few datasets with numeric variables on Kaggle.

## Dataset
You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires/download)(759 MB).
